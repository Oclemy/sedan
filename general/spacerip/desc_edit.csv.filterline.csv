HTGxCxNVn9g,Venus Death of a Planet 4k,Billions of years ago our nearest planetary neighbor Venus may have harbored lakes oceans and life-giving habitats similar to those on the early Earth. Today Venus spins slowly in a backward direction. It's a planet knocked upside down and turned inside out. Its burned-out surface is a global fossil of volcanic destruction shrouded in a dense toxic atmosphere. Scientists have come to see Venus as the alien planet “next door" a laboratory for testing ideas about how planets evolve and the challenges they face in nurturing life. They are now unveiling daring new strategies to reach down to its hostile surface. From floating bases stationed high in Venus’ atmosphere they hope to send down new generation probes to search for clues from a time when the planet was alive. How did Venus descend into this hellish state? And how did its sister planet Earth manage to survive?,50m 11s,2020-10-16T19:00:10Z

oC31pqk9sak,Why Mars Died and Earth Lived,Hey Everyone You can find our 4K UHD content and more great space and science shows on:  The Mars rover Curiosity is the latest in a long line of missions to Mars: landers sent to scoop its soil and study its rocks orbiters sent to map its valleys and ridges. They are all asking the same question. Did liquid water once flow on this dry and dusty world? Did it support life in any form? And are there remnants left to find? The science that comes out of these missions may help answer a much larger more philosophical question. Is our planet Earth the norm in a galaxy run through with life-bearing planets? Or is Earth a rare gem with a unique make-up and history that allowed it to give rise to living things? On Mars Curiosity has spotted pebbles and other rocks commonly associated with flowing water. It found them down stream on what appears to be an ancient river fan where water flowed down into Gale Crater. This shows that at some point in the past Mars had an atmosphere cloudy skies and liquid water flowing. So what could have turned it into the desolate world we know today? One process that very likely played a role goes by the unscientific name sputtering. Like the other planets in our solar system Mars is lashed by high-energy photons from the Sun. When one of these photons enters the atmosphere of a planet it can crash into a molecule knocking loose an electron and turning it into an ion. The solar wind brings something else: a giant magnetic field. When part of the field grazes the planet it can attract ions and launch them out into space. Another part might fling ions right into the atmosphere at up to a thousand kilometers per second. The ions crash into other molecules sending them in all directions like balls in a game of pool. Over billions of years this process could have literally stripped Mars of its atmosphere especially in the early life of the solar system when the solar wind was more intense than it is today. Sputtering has actually been spotted directly on another dead planet Venus. The Venus Express mission found that solar winds are steadily stripping off lighter molecules of hydrogen and oxygen. They escape the planet on the night side... then ride solar breezes on out into space. This process has left Venus with an atmosphere dominated by carbon dioxide gas... a heat trapping compound that has helped send surface temperatures up to around 400 degrees Celsius. The loss of Venus' atmosphere likely took place over millions of years especially during solar outbursts known as coronal mass ejections. If these massive blast waves stripped Venus and Mars of an atmosphere capable of supporting life how did Earth avoid the same grim fate? We can see the answer as the solar storm approaches earth. Our planet has what Mars and Venus lack - a powerful magnetic field generated deep within its core. This protective shield deflects many of the high-energy particles launched by the Sun. In fact that's just our first line of defense. Much of the solar energy that gets through is reflected back to space by clouds ice and snow. The energy that earth absorbs is just enough to power a remarkable planetary engine: the climate. It's set in motion by the uneveness of solar heating due in part to the cycles of day and night and the seasons. That causes warm tropical winds to blow toward the poles and cold polar air toward the equator. Wind currents drive surface ocean currents. This computer simulation shows the Gulf Stream winding its way along the coast of North America. This great ocean river carries enough heat energy to power the industrial world a hundred times over. It breaks down in massive whirlpools that spread warm tropical waters over northern seas. Below the surface they mix with cold deep currents that swirl around undersea ledges and mountains. Earth's climate engine has countless moving parts: tides and terrain cross winds and currents -- all working to equalize temperatures around the globe. Over time earth developed a carbon cycle and an effective means of regulating green house gases. In our galaxy are still-born worlds like Mars the norm? Or in Earth has Nature crafted a prototype for its greatest experiment... Life?,9m 32s,2012-10-13T15:28:45Z

It's now playing at the National Air & Space Museum in Washington DC and full dome theaters around the world. The show explores the inner workings of Earth's climate system. With visualizations based on satellite monitoring data and advanced supercomputer simulations this cutting-edge production follows a trail of energy that flows from the Sun into the interlocking systems that shape our climate: the atmosphere oceans and the biosphere. Audiences will ride along on swirling ocean and wind currents dive into the heart of a monster hurricane come face-to-face with sharks and gigantic whales and fly into roiling volcanoes. Dynamic Earth explores concepts and terms essential to understanding the climate: · The relationship of Earth and the Sun. The Earth is close enough to the Sun to bask in its warmth thanks to a series of natural defenses including its magnetic field. · Life and the carbon cycle. Earth's climate control system depends on the ability of living organisms to remove CO2 from the atmosphere and store it long term. · Plate tectonics and its role in the carbon cycle. Audiences will learn that CO2 emissions from human activities now outpace volcanoes 200 fold. · Comparision with Venus. The story of our sister planet shows just how unique Earth is in its ability to regulate atmospheric CO2 and global temperatures. · Perspective on climate change. The program fills in major gaps in the public's understanding of climate change by placing it in a broader context of what shapes Earth's climate.

-EV3pzjwJpE,Wandering Stars: a tour of the planets,A beauteous rip through the solar sytem based on NASA's Science on a Sphere program The Wanderers. In ancient times humans watched the skies looking for clues to their future and to aid in their very survival. They soon observed that some stars were not fixed but moved in the sky from night to night. They called these stars the wanderers. At the center of our solar system is the sun binding the planets with its gravitational pull. From our viewpoint on earth the sun appears small in the sky but in reality it dwarfs even Jupiter the largest planet in the solar system. The distance from the sun to the small worlds traveling it are vast. Light takes eight minutes to reach earth and nearly a day to reach the farthest known bodies. Join us now as we tour our solar system starting with sun-baked mercury and traveling to the remotest outskirts where small icy bodies move with only the faintest connection to our sun. Mercury Mercury the closest planet to Sun is also the smallest terrestrial planet. It orbits so swiftly that its year lasts only 88 Earth days. The airless cratered surface could almost be mistaken for our moon relentlessly bombarded by meteoroids for four and a half billion years. One of these encounters left a giant scar called the golarus basin one of the largest impact sights in the solar system. Temperatures on the surface of mercury can reach a blistering 800 degrees Fahrenheit and can dip to 300 degrees below zero on the night side. Venus Venus as seen from Earth is the brightest object in sky after the Sun and Moon. Russian probes were the first to land on Venus in the 1970's and 1980's. Venus's surface is volcanic. Its atmosphere is composed of thick dense carbon dioxide with sulfuric acid clouds. Both are potent greenhouse gases that trap incoming sunlight. Venus rotates slowly—one Venusian day lasts almost four Earth months. Earth Earth is the only planet with life as we know it. The atmosphere and temperatures are just right for life. It is the only known body in our solar system where water can exist as a gas liquid and solid. Vast oceans dominate surface of the planet. Seasonal changes occur on the surface. Earth has a solid surface that constantly shifts due to plate tectonics. Mars Once geologically active Mars has the largest dormant volcano in the solar system Olympus Mons. It also hast the longest valley in the solar system called Valles Marineris. Mars has a thin atmosphere primarily composed of carbon dioxide. Surface conditions are dynamic. Mars has seasons as well as massive dust storms that cover the planet. Its surface features include the smooth low-lying northern hemisphere and the craggy heavily-cratered southern uplands. Evidence suggests that Mars had water running on its surface at some time in the past. Asteroid belt The asteroid belt is composed of small rocky pieces. The big question is What happened here? and Why no planets? The asteroid Ceres is large enough to be classified as a dwarf planet. Jupiter Jupiter is the largest and most massive planet in the Solar System. It rotates rapidly completing one rotation every 10 hours. Long-lasting high-speed winds and storms dominate Jupiter's atmosphere. Jupiter has a faint planetary ring system and over 63 moons. The largest moons discovered by Galileo in 1610 vary widely. Io is volcanically active. Europa's cracked surface likely hides an ocean below. Ganymede is the largest moon in the Solar System. Callisto is heavily cratered. Saturn Saturn's seemingly serene atmosphere hides powerful storms and winds on its surface. Saturn is known for its extensive ring system made of chunks of ice rock and dust with small moonlets embedded within the rings. Saturn has more than 60 moons. Conditions vary among the moons. Titan the largest moon has a thick smoggy atmosphere covering its icy surface with lakes of liquid methane or ethane. Small Enceladus has water and ice geysers at its south pole. Its water vapor coat other nearby moons and create a thin Saturn ring. Uranus Uranus receives 400 times less sunlight than Earth. Uranus lies nearly sideways making its axis nearly parallel to the plane of the Solar System. This extreme tilt give rise to seasons that last nearly 28 Earth years. Uranus as many moons and a faint ring system. It has only been visited by one spacecraft Voyager 2 in 1986. Like the other giant planets Uranus's atmosphere is primarily hydrogen and helium with a trace of methane gas over deep clouds giving it a pale blue-green tint. Neptune Neptune also has many moons and a faint ring system. Its Great Dark Spot a large storm with extremely strong winds disappeared in the 1990s. Neptune's vivid blue color is due to its frigid temperature: -371°F (-224 °C).,14m 47s,2012-03-01T20:48:17Z
Hgf3i__YDrc,Unexplained Gamma-Ray Pulsar,From NASA Astrophysics and Goddard Space Flight Center. In December 2010 a pair of mismatched stars in the southern constellation Crux whisked past each other at a distance closer than Venus orbits the sun. The system possesses a so-far unique blend of a hot and massive star with a compact fast-spinning pulsar. The pair's closest encounters occur every 3.4 years and each is marked by a sharp increase in gamma rays the most extreme form of light. The unique combination of stars the long wait between close approaches and periods of intense gamma-ray emission make this system irresistible to astrophysicists. Now a team using NASA's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope to observe the 2010 encounter reports that the system displayed fascinating and unanticipated activity. Every 3.4 years pulsar B1259-63 dives twice through the gas disk surrounding the massive blue star it orbits. With each pass it produces gamma rays. During the most recent event NASA's Fermi observed that the pulsar's gamma-ray flare was much more intense the second time it plunged through the disk. Astronomers don't yet know why. Few pairings in astronomy are as peculiar as high-mass binaries where a hot blue-white star many times the sun's mass and temperature is joined by a compact companion no bigger than Earth -- and likely much smaller. Depending on the system this companion may be a burned-out star known as a white dwarf a city-sized remnant called a neutron star (also known as a pulsar) or most exotically a black hole. Just four of these odd couple binaries were known to produce gamma rays but in only one of them did astronomers know the nature of the compact object. That binary consists of a pulsar designated PSR B1259-63 and a 10th-magnitude Be-type star known as LS 2883. The pair lies 8000 light-years away. The pulsar is a fast-spinning neutron star with a strong magnetic field. This combination powers a lighthouse-like beam of energy which astronomers can easily locate if the beam happens to sweep toward Earth. The beam from PSR B1259-63 was discovered in 1989 by the Parkes radio telescope in Australia. The neutron star is about the size of Washington D.C. weighs about twice the sun's mass and spins almost 21 times a second. The pulsar follows an eccentric and steeply inclined orbit around LS 2883 which weighs roughly 24 solar masses and spans about nine times its size. This hot blue star sits embedded in a disk of gas that flows out from its equatorial region. At closest approach the pulsar passes less than 63 million miles from its star -- so close that it skirts the gas disk around the star's middle. The pulsar punches through the disk on the inbound leg of its orbit. Then it swings around the star at closest approach and plunges through the disk again on the way out.,2m 8s,2011-06-30T02:58:54Z
YL__UbPsPDg,Saturn's Mysterious Moons,Launched three years before the new century... a spacecraft wound its way through the empty reaches of the solar system. On Earth its progress was little noted as it swung twice by the planet Venus then our moon. And Earth. The asteroid belt. And Jupiter. Almost seven years later on the first of July 2004 the Cassini probe entered the orbit of Saturn. It then began to compile what has become one of the greatest photographic collections of all time of a giant gas planet surrounded by colorful rings guarded by a diverse collection of moons and millions of tiny moonlets. Within this record is a trail of clues... pointing to the energy sources and complex chemistry needed to spawn life. What are these mysterious worlds telling us about the universe and Earth? In the outer reaches of the solar system a billion and a half kilometers from the Sun... there is a little world known as Enceladus. Nearly all of the sunlight that strikes its icy surface is reflected back into space making it one of the brightest objects in the solar system. At its equator the average temperature is minus 198 degrees Celsius. It can rise about 70 degrees higher in grooves that stretch across the south pole like tiger stripes. Looming over it is the giant planet Saturn. In myth Saturn - the Roman name for the primal Greek God Chronos - was the youngest son of Gaia or Earth and Uranus sky. Wielding a scythe provided by his mother the story goes Saturn confronted his abusive father castrating him. The blood of Uranus flowed into the seas fertilizing the Earth and giving rise to Enceladus and other giant offspring. Saturn's moon Enceladus has its own tangled story. In 2005 the Cassini spacecraft spotted plumes of water vapor shooting out into space from its south pole. More recent close encounters have revealed jets of water flavored by slightly salty chemical compounds spewing out from vents in the rough cracked polar terrain. That may mean that Enceladus harbors a remarkable secret below its frigid surface: A liquid ocean and perhaps a chemical environment that could spawn simple life forms. It's not the only promising stop in the realm of Saturn. The moon Titan is often said to resemble Earth in its early days. It is lined with volcanoes and a hazy atmosphere rich in organic compounds. While Enceladus is the size of Great Britain Titan is ten times larger 50% larger than our moon and the second largest moon in our solar system. We've known about Titan since the astronomer Christian Huygens discovered it in 1655 and Enceladus since William Herschel spotted it in August 1789 just after the start of the French Revolution. Scientists began to investigate these moons in earnest with the launch of the two Voyager spacecraft in 1977. The lineup of outer planets in the solar system allowed the spacecraft to fly past each of them. They disclosed new details about their magnetic fields atmospheres ring systems and inner cores. But what really turned heads were the varied shapes and surfaces of their moons. They've all been pummeled over the millennia by wayward asteroids and comets. A few appear to be sculpted by forces below their surfaces. Neptune's largest moon Triton has few craters. It's marked with circular depressions bounded by rugged ridges. There are also grooves and folds that stretch for dozens of miles a sign of fracturing and deforming. Triton has geysers too shooting some five miles above the surface. But on this frigid moon -- so far from the Sun -- the liquid that spouts is not water but nitrogen. Tiny Miranda one of 27 known moons that orbit Uranus wears a jumbled skin that's been shaped and reshaped by forces within. Jupiter's moon Io -- orbiting perilously close to the giant planet is literally turning itself inside out. Rivers of lava roll down from open craters that erupt like fountains. Flying by Europa Voyager documented a complex network of criss-crossing grooves and ridges. In the 1990s the Galileo spacecraft went back to get a closer look. It found that Europa's surface is a crazy quilt of fractured plates cliff faces and gullies... amid long grooves like a network of superhighways. How did it get like this? Then heat rising up through a subsurface ocean of liquid water cracks and shifts and spreads the icy surface in a thousand different ways. Europa's neighbors Callisto and Ganymede show similar features suggesting they too may have liquid oceans below their surfaces. Crossing outward to Saturn Voyager found a similar surface on the moon Enceladus. So when the Cassini spacecraft arrived in 2004 it came looking for answers to a range of burning questions: if this moon and others have subsurface oceans? Do they also have the ability to cook up and support life? And what could they tell us about the origin of life throughout the galaxy?,25m 15s,2011-04-14T21:14:02Z
FDyszoB0A0c,When Worlds Collide,Nearly 60 years ago audiences thrilled to the destruction of the Earth in George Pal's classic film When Worlds Collide. The idea of a planetary smash-up is a staple of science fiction but can it really happen? Astronomers using NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope think they've actually seen the aftermath of such a collision around another star. The story unfolded as Dr. Casey Lisse and his team studied disks around young stars. Once planets have formed astronomers think there are a lot of left-over asteroids in the system. They occasionally slam together and produce dusty debris. Spitzer's Infrared Spectrograph was designed to detect the faint glow from this material. By spreading the light out into its component colors astronomers can look for the spectral fingerprints of different minerals. Our dusty star of interest is a faint speck known as HD 172555. It's about 100 light years away and 12 million years old which compared to our 4.5 billion year old Sun is like a baby born a few days ago. Studying its spectrum Dr. Lisse and his colleagues realized they had found something very peculiar that they had not seen around other stars. Aside from the usual indicators of rocky rubble they found features corresponding to tektite obsidian and silicon monoxide gas. What's strange is that tektite and obsidian are formed from molten materials. Tektites are hardened chunks of lava found around meteor impacts on Earth and obsidian is volcanic glass. Vaporized rocks can form silicon monoxide gas. You don't get this kind of material by just smashing a couple of asteroids together. The evidence suggests something much more... cataclysmic. Imagine what would happen if our moon slammed at high velocity into a Mercury-sized planet. The resulting impact would eject a massive amount of molten material into space. As it cooled it would likely form tektite obsidian and silicon monoxide gas explaining the features seen in the HD 172555 spectrum. It's amazing to think Spitzer may have caught the aftermath of such an incredible collision. But it's not the first time astronomers have speculated about world-shattering events. In fact similar things may have happened right here in our own back yard. Mercury is a strangely dense planet compared to the other worlds in the solar system. Now if it formed from the same stuff as Venus and Earth why would it be any different? A world-shattering impact could be the answer. When planets form the lighter materials rise and denser ones sink to the core. Remove the outer lighter layers and you're left with a denser planet once what's left cools off. Looking to our neighbor Mars we see a massive impact scar in its Southern hemisphere. This area known as the Hellas Basin must have formed from an asteroid impact long ago. The resulting plume of molten material would have been blasted into space some of it eventually reaching the ancient Earth. Even closer to home most astronomers believe that our own moon was formed in a similar cataclysm. The theory is that a Mars-sized body grazed the still- forming Earth generating a massive amount of molten debris. The orbiting rubble would clump together over time forming the moon. The tektite and obsidian debris from such massive impacts would not last long around our sun or others. Solar winds and gravitational interactions tend to sweep away the dust over time and in a few tens of thousands of years the evidence would be erased. In the long history of our solar system that's hardly the blink of any eye. The evidence may be long gone here but seeing what may happen when worlds collide around a nearby star shows us it's not just science fiction after all.,5m 8s,2010-06-16T16:58:57Z
